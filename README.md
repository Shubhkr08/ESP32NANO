# ESP32NANO
I made a custom Esp32 board based on ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 , it has a USB type C and i tried to keep the size of the board as small as possible and to have as much as useful pins available on the board.

## Overview
This project is a **compact 2-layer development board** based on the **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module**. It exposes **all usable GPIOs**, includes onboard **3.3V regulation**, and USB connectivity for easy programming and prototyping. 
The goal of this project is to **learn PCB design, microcontroller integration, and embedded programming**, while creating a versatile dev board for IoT, robotics, and electronics experiments.
## Features
- ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module (Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 5.0)
- 2-layer compact PCB
- All GPIOs broken out (total 16+17= 33)
- USB connection for programming and power
- Onboard 3.3V voltage regulation
- Compact footprint for small projects
- Educational focus for learning MCU integration and PCB design
